Plan for Completing the Technical Assessment
1. Project Setup and Initial Configuration
Set up a GitHub Repository: Create a new repository to store all the project files.
Docker Initialization: Create a Dockerfile for containerizing the application, and set up Docker Compose for multi-container deployment if needed.
Environment Configuration: Set up a .env file to manage API keys and other sensitive information securely.

2. Data Ingestion
API Integration: Write a Python script to extract clinical trial data from the ClinicalTrials.gov API.
Use the requests library to fetch data.
Implement error handling to manage API rate limits and timeouts.
Store the raw data in a staging area (e.g., a local directory or cloud storage bucket).
DLT Integration: Use DLT (Delta Live Tables) to manage the ingestion process, ensuring data quality and schema enforcement.
Configure DLT pipelines for initial ingestion and incremental updates.

3. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Data Cleaning: Implement data cleaning steps using Python and DLT.
Handle missing values, normalize data formats (e.g., date formats, text normalization), and remove duplicates.
Data Transformation with dbt: Set up dbt models to transform the cleaned data into a structured format ready for analysis.
Create dbt models for key entities (e.g., patients, diseases, medications).
Use dbt's testing framework to validate the transformations.

4. Data Storage
Data Warehouse Setup: Use postgres for local development and testing. Alternatively, you can configure a cloud-based data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery or Snowflake).
Define the database schema using SQL scripts or dbt models.
Load transformed data into the data warehouse.

5. Entity Standardization with GPT-3.5
OpenAI Integration: Use GPT-3.5 API to standardize a specific entity, such as diseases or medications.
Write a function to make API calls to GPT-3.5 and process the responses.
Integrate this function into the data pipeline to standardize data before storage.

6. Machine Learning Model Integration
Basic Model Setup: Develop a simple machine learning model to predict patient outcomes using the cleaned and transformed data.
Use a Python library like scikit-learn or TensorFlow for model training and validation.
Integrate the model training process into the pipeline.
Save the trained model for later use or predictions.

7. Containerization and Orchestration
Docker Configuration: Ensure that the entire pipeline, including the API integration, data processing, and machine learning model, is containerized.
Create Docker Compose configurations if multiple services (e.g., API, database, ML model) are involved.
Testing: Test the pipeline locally using Docker to ensure that all components work together seamlessly.

8. Documentation and Delivery
README File: Write a comprehensive README file with:
Project overview.
Step-by-step setup instructions.
How to run the pipeline.
Explanation of the architecture and design choices.
Code Comments and Documentation: Ensure that the code is well-commented and includes docstrings for key functions and classes.
Database Schema Documentation: Include SQL scripts or dbt models for setting up the data warehouse schema in the repository.
Deployment Instructions: Provide a guide on how to deploy the pipeline in a production environment.

9. Next Steps for Productionization
CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
Monitoring and Alerting: Implement monitoring tools like Prometheus or Datadog to track pipeline performance and alert on failures.
Scaling Considerations: Plan for scaling the pipeline to handle larger datasets, potentially using cloud services for storage and compute.
Data Governance: Implement data governance practices, including data lineage tracking, access controls, and auditing.
